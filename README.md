ModulesNetwork language
=====================

Goals of language:
=====================

This language is created for game developers and other applications that need to use third-party modules at runtime. Game developers will be able to create a beautiful API for the user who can implement any of their ideas using C++

The language can be completely said to be a fork from C++, it only adds certain keywords for creating modules and applications. You can write in C++ using modules written in mnet and vice versa.

Since mnet is backward compatible with C++, you can easily add it to your project

**In active development**

**3rd party:**
=====================

**boost, vcpkg**
